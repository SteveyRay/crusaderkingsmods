#idea for decision- build a bunch of great welknyd stones and place them as focus points for several wells,
#then use them to conduct a ritual that has a high chance of destroying shit. Lower chance based on learning and traits- ideas is to allow
#cool shit for incompetent characters that have high tech.

#another idea, add ambition to explore ancestral runs- for ayleids allows for chance to develop welkynd researcher- learning gives chance to fire events to upgrade on successive ruin visits.
#bloodline ideas- capital scope-
