atw_twyll_3atw_desc;The centerpiece of the monument has been refurbished to make better use of metoric components and now resembles, if not curdely, a Twyllvarlais of old. Much like it's apperance, it's capacity is likewise similar and it can now actively channel magicka for purposes other than maintaining itself.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
